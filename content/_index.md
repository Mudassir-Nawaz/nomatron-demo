################ Problem
problem:
    title: "Built on Nomad. Simplified by Nomatron."
    content: "HashiCorp Nomad is a powerful scheduler, trusted by teams to run applications at scale. But getting from a job file in Git to a secure, repeatable deployment process often requires teams to build their own tooling. As organisations grow, managing multiple environments, clusters, and approval workflows becomes increasingly complex."

      title: "Our vision. One workflow, any runtime"
      content: >-
        Nomatron’s mission is to save platform teams time and reduce operational costs by unifying deployments into a single workflow.<br><br>
        We’re starting with Nomad — but the same simplicity will power deployments across runtimes in the future.<br><br>
        Imagine a world where:<br>
        <ul class="ml-10 mt-3 list-disc">
          <li>Every deployment, no matter the runtime, follows the same trusted workflow.</li><br>
          <li>Platform teams spend less time maintaining bespoke scripts and more time enabling developers.</li><br>
          <li>Security, governance, and auditability are built in, not bolted on.</li><br>
          <li>Developers move faster because complexity is abstracted away.</li><br><br>
        </ul>
        Nomatron is building the future of application delivery: flexible, secure, and runtime-agnostic.
